Jeepney Jump is an offline-enabled Filipino-themed 2D endless obstacle game. Built in JavaScript, it is a single-page, client-side web application that utilizes [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack). Touch events are enabled to also be enjoyed on mobile devices.

As the player, you control a jeepney, an iconic form of public transit in the Philippines.

As the jeepney travels a 2D boulevard in metro Manila, the player uses the space bar to jump and avoid obstacles.

The player begins with 5 health, losing one upon each collision. Health can be regained by picking up bonus items--lumpia and mango, two famous Filipino foods--along the way. If a player is at maximum health, collecting a bonus item will result in the earning of additional points.

Difficulty is automatically increased based on the amount of time the player survives. Difficulty is incremented by increasing the speed of passing obstacles and bonus items.

A player's high score is stored and retrieved via `localStorage`.
